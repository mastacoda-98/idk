            <p id="speech">Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. 
               The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would 
               you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your 
               ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your 
               right side? Usually you would take the one on your left 
               side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on 
               society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute 
               ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that 
               ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own 
               napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin 
               to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to 
               also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. 
               Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because 
               they have no other option. This is ‘society’…</p>
